### COVID-19: towards controlling of a pandemic (DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30673-5) 3.17
> Fill gaps in understanding of the natural history of infection to better define the period of infectiousness and transmissibility; more accurately estimate the reproductive number in various outbreak settings and improve understanding the role of asymptomatic infection.

### COVID-19: delay, mitigate, and communicate (DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30128-4) 3.16
> The UK preparedness plan for tackling COVID-19 includes four phases: containment, delay, mitigation, and, alongside these, research to better understand the disease and its effects, and to address the challenges of imperfect diagnostic approaches and absence of proven treatments or a vaccine.

### Investigation of three clusters of COVID-19 in Singapore: implications for surveillance and response measures (DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30528-6) 3.16
> The median incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 was 4 days (IQR 3–6). The serial interval between transmission pairs ranged between 3 days and 8 days.

### First known person-to-person transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the USA (DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30607-3) 3.13
> Person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurred between two people with prolonged, unprotected exposure while Patient 1 was symptomatic.

### Real estimates of mortality following COVID-19 infection (DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30195-X) 3.12
> The maximum incubation period is assumed to be up to 14 days, whereas the median time from onset of symptoms to intensive care unit (ICU) admission is around 10 days. Recently, WHO reported that the time between symptom onset and death ranged from about 2 weeks to 8 weeks.

### COVID-19: a potential public health problem for homeless populations (DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-2667(20)30053-0) 3.11
> In the USA, more than 500 000 people were reported to be experiencing homelessness on any given night over the past decade (2007–19).1
The State of Homelessness in Canada 2016 report2
estimated 35 000 people are experiencing homelessness on any given night in Canada.
