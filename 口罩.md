## Mask

- **Surgical mask**: microbes in droplets and aerosols
- **Dust mask**: dusts and allergens
- **Paint mask**: mists and vapors

## Respirator 
- Air-purifying 
- Air-supplied

## Surgical mask standards
- **Fluid Resistance**: Mask resistance to penetration by synthetic blood under pressure (mmHg). Higher resistance = higher protection
- **BFE - Bacterial Filtration Efficiency**: Percentage of particles filtered out at a pore size of 1.0-5.0 microns. 3.0 μm, 32 lpm
- **PFE - Particle Filtration Efficiency**: Percentage of particles filtered out t a pore size of 0.1-1.0 microns.   0.1 μm, 28 lpm 
- **Delta P - Differential Pressure**: Pressure drop across mask, or resistance to air flow in mmH2O/cm2. Greater resistance = better protection but less breathability.
- **Flame Spread**: Measures the flame spread of the mask material.

## Air-purifying respirator's mechanical filter

### Principles
1. by interception when particles following a line of flow in the airstream come within one radius of a fiber and adhere to it;
2. by impaction, when larger particles unable to follow the curving contours of the airstream are forced to embed in one of the fibers directly; this increases with diminishing fiber separation and higher air flow velocity
3. by an enhancing mechanism called diffusion, where gas molecules collide with the smallest particles, especially those below 100 nm in diameter, which are thereby impeded and delayed in their path through the filter; this effect is similar to Brownian motion and increases the probability that particles will be stopped by either of the two mechanisms above; it becomes dominant at lower air flow velocities
4. by using certain resins, waxes, and plastics as coatings on the filter material to attract particles with an electrostatic charge that holds them on the filter surface;
5. by using gravity and allowing particles to settle into the filter material (this effect is typically negligible); and
6. by using the particles themselves, after the filter has been used, to act as a filter medium for other particles.

Considering only particulates carried on an air stream and a fiber mesh filter, diffusion predominates below the 0.1 μm diameter particle size. Impaction and interception predominate above 0.4 μm. In between, near the 0.3 μm most penetrating particle size, diffusion and interception predominate.
