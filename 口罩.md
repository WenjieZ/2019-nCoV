## Air-purifying respirator's mechanical filter

### Principles
1. by interception when particles following a line of flow in the airstream come within one radius of a fiber and adhere to it;
2. by impaction, when larger particles unable to follow the curving contours of the airstream are forced to embed in one of the fibers directly; this increases with diminishing fiber separation and higher air flow velocity
3. by an enhancing mechanism called diffusion, where gas molecules collide with the smallest particles, especially those below 100 nm in diameter, which are thereby impeded and delayed in their path through the filter; this effect is similar to Brownian motion and increases the probability that particles will be stopped by either of the two mechanisms above; it becomes dominant at lower air flow velocities
4. by using certain resins, waxes, and plastics as coatings on the filter material to attract particles with an electrostatic charge that holds them on the filter surface;
5. by using gravity and allowing particles to settle into the filter material (this effect is typically negligible); and
6. by using the particles themselves, after the filter has been used, to act as a filter medium for other particles.
